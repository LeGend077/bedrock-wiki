In this tutorial, you will learn how to spawn a pre-tamed entity by running an event on the player you want the entity tamed to, and by throwing an item that transforms into a tamed entity upon impact.

## Overview

Traditionally, if you wanted entity tamed by a player, you had to force the player to interact with that entity through `minecraft:tameable`. However, you can also take advantage of the fact that vanilla projectiles keep track of the entity responsible for spawning\* them to spawn an entity pre-tamed.

To do this, we'll summon a dummy middle-man projectile entity through `minecraft:spawn_entity`, which will instantly transform into the entity we want to spawn pre-tamed in this tutorial, a vanilla wolf through `minecraft:transformation` with `keep_owner` set to `true`.

\*: _Spawning_ should not be confused with _summoning_. The projectile will keep track of the player if it was spawned by a spawn egg or `minecraft:spawn_entity` component, but not by a `/summon` command.

## player.json

Here, we'll need a copy of the player's behavior file, which we will modify slightly. we'll add a simple event that adds a component group which will spawn our custom middle-man entity.

You can find the BP player entity file in the vanilla behavior pack provided by Mojang [here](https://aka.ms/behaviorpacktemplate).

<CodeHeader>BP/entities/player.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version":"1.16.0",
    "minecraft:entity":{
        "description":{
            "identifier":"minecraft:player",
            "is_spawnable":false,
            "is_summonable":false,
            "is_experimental":false
        },
        "component_groups":{
            "wiki:spawn_tamed_wolf":{
                "minecraft:spawn_entity":{
                    "entities":{
                        "min_wait_time":0,
                        "max_wait_time":0,
                        "spawn_entity":"wiki:pretamed_wolf",
                        "single_use":true,
                        "num_to_spawn":1
                    }
                }
            }
		},
        ...
		"events":{
            "wiki:spawn_tamed_wolf":{
                "add":{
                    "component_groups":[
                        "wiki:spawn_tamed_wolf"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## pretamed_wolf.json

Afterwards, we'll need to create a simple custom entity that will have the `minecraft:arrow` runtime identifier (other projectile runtime identifiers work as well), an empty projectile component, and a trasnfomation component to turn into a tamed wolf.

<CodeHeader>BP/entities/pretamed_wolf.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"format_version": "1.16.0",
	"minecraft:entity": {
		"description": {
			"identifier": "wiki:pretamed_wolf",
			"runtime_identifier": "minecraft:arrow",
			"is_spawnable": false,
			"is_summonable": true,
			"is_experimental": false
		},
		"components": {
			"minecraft:projectile": {},
			"minecraft:transformation": {
				"into": "minecraft:wolf<minecraft:on_tame>",
				"keep_owner": true
			}
		}
	}
}
```

And now, you can spawn a tamed wolf next to the player with `/event entity @p wiki:spawn_tamed_wolf`. You can also spawn it with a `wiki:pretamed_wolf` spawn egg by setting `is_spawnable` to `true`!

## Integrating Item Projectiles (Alternate Method)

Introduced as one of [1.16's experimental item features](/items/items-16), the `shoot` event property can be used to make projectiles that transform into tamed entities upon impact.

<CodeHeader>BP/items/throwable_pretamed_wolf.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version":"1.16.100",
    "minecraft:item":{
        "description":{
            "identifier":"wiki:throwable_pretamed_wolf"
        },
        "components":{
            "minecraft:on_use":{
                "on_use":{
                    "event":"wiki:on_use"
                }
            }
        },
        "events":{
            "wiki:on_use":{
                "shoot":{
                    "projectile":"wiki:pretamed_wolf"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We'll also need to make some adjustment to our custom projectile entity so that it doesn't transform right as it spawns.

```json
{
    "minecraft:entity":{
        "description":{
            "identifier":"wiki:pretamed_wolf",
            "runtime_identifier":"minecraft:arrow",
            "is_spawnable":false,
            "is_summonable":true,
            "is_experimental":false
        },
        "component_groups":{
            "wiki:transform_to_entity":{
                "minecraft:transformation":{
                    "into":"minecraft:wolf<minecraft:on_tame>",
                    "keep_owner":true
                }
            }
        },
        "components":{
            "minecraft:projectile":{
                "on_hit":{
                    "impact_damage":{
                        "damage":0
                    },
                    "stick_in_ground":{},
                    "definition_event":{
                        "event_trigger":{
                            "event":"wiki:on_hit"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "events":{
            "wiki:on_hit":{
                "add":{
                    "component_groups":[
                        "wiki:transform_to_entity"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
