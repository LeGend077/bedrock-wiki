## What does the template contain?

The template contains 2 editable folders; `holograms` and `textures`,
these folders contain the models and textures for the vr objects.

## Holograms

This folder contains all the models the VR version of Minecraft uses, for example the VR hands.

## Textures

This folder stores all textures for the models.

## Merging the VR template with your own pack

This pack depends on the `contents.json` and `textures_list.json` to work. All assets from your pack, that the game will use, need to be defined in there.
If you have 2 of the same files you are ought to combine them.
