## Introduction

This system will run your desired commands on the event that a player dies.

```yaml
/scoreboard players set @a [scores={alive=!2}] alive 0
/scoreboard players set @e [type=player] alive 1

/execute as @a [scores={alive=0}] run say I died


/scoreboard players set @a [scores={alive=0}] alive 2
```

Here we have used an `/execute - say` command as an example but you can use any command you prefer and as many as you require.

Just make sure to follow the given order and properly add the selector argument ` scores={alive=0} ` as shown for your desired commands.

## Explanation

- **` alive=0 `** this means player is dead.
- **` alive=1 `** this means player is alive.
- **` alive=2 `** this means player is dead and we have run our desired commands on/from them.


- **` @a `** selector will target all players alive/dead so we use it to mark everyone as 0 'dead.'
    - Note: we will ignore 2 or it will end up making the commands execute on dead players again. We only want our commands to execute once.


- **` @e `** selector on the other hand will only target players who are alive, so we can use this to mark all alive players 1 'alive.'


- Now that dead players are 0 and alive players are 1 we can use this knowledge to run our desired commands on the dead players.
    - Keep in mind we need to set their score to 2 after or otherwise the commands will keep executing till they respawn.
