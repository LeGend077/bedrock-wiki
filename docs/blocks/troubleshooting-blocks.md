## Step-by-step Block Debugging

## 0.0.0 - Trouble

I followed a tutorial or tried to make my own block and something's wrong! Calm down. This page will help debug common issues. <BButton color="blue" link="troubleshooting-blocks#_1-0-0-my-block-has-a-black-magenta-checkered-pattern-my-textures-are-missing">Continue</BButton>

## 1.0.0 - My Block Has a Black-Magenta checkered pattern/My Textures Are Missing!

I will be reviewing three different types of blocks that have different layouts: Dirt-like ![](/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/tr_dirt.png), Log-like ![](/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/tr_log.png), Grass-like ![](/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/tr_grass.png)

1.10 Block <BButton color="blue" link="troubleshooting-blocks#_1-10-blocks">Continue</BButton>

1.16.100 Block <BButton color="blue" link="troubleshooting-blocks#_1-16-100-blocks">Continue</BButton>

## 1.10 Blocks

Navigate to your `blocks.json`. Ensure that it is properly named.

<CodeHeader>RP/blocks.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"format_version": [1, 1, 0],
	"wiki:dirt_like": {
		"textures": "dirt_like", //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		"sound": "your_sound_name"
	},
	"wiki:log_like": {
		"textures": {
			"up": "log_like_top", //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
			"down": "log_like_top", //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
			"side": "log_like_side" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"sound": "your_sound_name"
	},
	"wiki:grass_like": {
		"textures": {
			"up": "grass_like_top", //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
			"down": "grass_like_bottom", //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
			"side": "grass_like_side" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"sound": "your_sound_name"
	}
}
```

Next, navigate to your `terrain_texture.json`. Ensure that it is properly named.

<CodeHeader>RP/textures/terrain_texture.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"resource_pack_name": "tut",
	"texture_name": "atlas.terrain",
	"padding": 8,
	"num_mip_levels": 4,
	"texture_data": {
		"dirt_like": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/dirt_like" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"log_like_top": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/log_like_top" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"log_like_side": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/log_like_side" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"grass_like_top": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/grass_like_top" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"grass_like_bottom": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/grass_like_bottom" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"grass_like_side": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/grass_like_side" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		}
	}
}
```

If you followed this properly, your 1.10 block should now have correct texture.

## 1.16.100 Blocks

You can follow the exact same steps as the 1.10 blocks. But doing this method allows you to rotate your blocks.
Navigate to your `terrain_texture.json`. Ensure that it is properly named

<CodeHeader>RP/textures/terrain_texture.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"resource_pack_name": "tut",
	"texture_name": "atlas.terrain",
	"padding": 8,
	"num_mip_levels": 4,
	"texture_data": {
		"dirt_like": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/dirt_like" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"log_like_top": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/log_like_top" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"log_like_side": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/log_like_side" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"grass_like_top": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/grass_like_top" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"grass_like_bottom": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/grass_like_bottom" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"grass_like_side": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/grass_like_side" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		}
	}
}
```

Next, navigate to your block file. In your block file, make sure you have the `material_instances` component.

Dirt like block example:
<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/dirt_like.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.16.100",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "wiki:dirt_like",
            "register_to_creative_menu": true
        },
        "components": {
            "minecraft:material_instances": {
                "*": {
                    "texture": "dirt_like",
                }
            },
            ...
        },
        "events": {...}
    }
}
```

Log like block example:
<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/log_like.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.16.100",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "wiki:log_like",
            "register_to_creative_menu": true
        },
        "components": {
            "minecraft:material_instances": {
                "*": {
                    "texture": "log_like_side"
                },
                "ends": {
                    "texture": "log_like_top"
                },
                "up": "ends",
                "down": "ends"
            },
            ...
        },
        "events": {...}
    }
}
```

Grass like block example:
<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/grass_like.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.16.100",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "wiki:grass_like",
            "register_to_creative_menu": true
        },
        "components": {
            "minecraft:material_instances": {
                "*": {
                    "texture": "grass_like_side"
                },
                "up": {
                    "texture": "grass_like_top"
                },
                "down": {
                    "texture": "grass_like_bottom"
                }
            },
            ...
        },
        "events": {...}
    }
}
```

If you followed this properly, your 1.16.100 block should now have correct texture.

## 2.0.0 - My Block Looks Like Dirt!

Problem: My custom block has turned into a dirt block with green writing on it. ![](/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/tr_update.png) This is called `info_update` block. This happens when the block identifier changed or an invalid json was made.

Solution: Use a json linter and double check that your identifier didn't change.

<a name="3.0.0"></a>

## 3.0.0 - Block Rendering

This section will describe common block rendering issues and how to fix them.

## 3.1.0 - Block isn't transparent!

Problem: You have transparent pixels in your texture file. When you apply it in game, they become opaque.

Solution: Navigate to your block file. Navigate to your `material_instances` component. Add the following to your component:

<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/your_block.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"format_version": "1.16.100",
	"minecraft:block": {
		"components": {
			"minecraft:material_instances": {
				"*": {
					"render_method": "alpha_test"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## 3.2.0 - Block has shadow!

Problem: You have block with custom geometry but it has shadow.

Solution: Navigate to your block file. Navigate to your `material_instances` component. Add the following to your component:

<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/your_block.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"format_version": "1.16.100",
	"minecraft:block": {
		"components": {
			"minecraft:material_instances": {
				"*": {
					"face_dimming": false,
					"ambient_occlusion": false
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Another method:

Add following components to your block's code:

<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/your_block.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"format_version": "1.16.100",
	"minecraft:block": {
		"components": {
			"minecraft:block_light_emission": 0.0,
			"minecraft:block_light_absorption": 0
		}
	}
}
```

## 3.3.0 - Block Renders Odd in Inventory

Problem: You have a block with custom geometry and it renders strange in inventory, like this:

![](/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/inventory_render_cubes.png)

Solution: In inventory, block's geometry is rendered by cubes, from the bottom to the top, where first ones overlap next. To render your block correctly, you'll need to change the order of the cubes in blockbench.

```
cube_middle      cube_bottom
cube_top     ->  cube_middle
cube_bottom      cube_top
```

## 3.4.0 - Block Looks Smaller in Inventory

Problem: You have a block with `"minecraft:unit_cube": {}` component and it looks smaller than vanilla blocks in inventory.

Solution: Block can get its visuals in two ways, either by applying textures in the blocks.json OR by giving the block a model and material instances.
Using the blocks.json causes the block to appear full sized in your inventory, but forces it to use opaque as a material and doesn't allow rotations through the component/change anything about the appearance. So what you do is use the fact that, if your block has no materials and model active from components or permutations, it will take the textures from the blocks.json causing the normal full sized block model. If you wanna make use of the rotation component you can't just apply it, you need to give it material instances, unit_cube or a custom model and the rotation component. This will make it rotatable and work fine, while the default state which uses the blocks.json shows normally in the end you only can use this for full 16³ blocks which are non transparent, but it's a neat life hack to make it not seem off.

## 4.0.0 - Common Content Log Errors

This section will describe common content log errors and how to debug them.

## 4.1.0 - [Blocks][error]

Problem: Your content log shows `[Blocks][error]-minecraft:entity_collision: min can't be below (-8, 0, -8) and max can't be more than (8, 16, 8)` or `[Blocks][error]-minecraft:pick_collision: min can't be below (-8, 0, -8) and max can't be more than (8, 16, 8)`

Solution: Check your `entity_collision` or `pick_collision` components and do the following:

-   Make sure the x or z isn't less than -8.
-   Make sure the y isn't less than 0.
-   Make sure the size isn't bigger than 16x16x16.

## 4.2.0 - [Blocks][error]

Problem: Your content log shows `geometry.your_block contains an X boxes outside the warning error of (*insert numbers*) to (*insert numbers*)`

Solution: Your geometry is bigger than 16x16x16. You can either make the geometry smaller or use geo fixer.
