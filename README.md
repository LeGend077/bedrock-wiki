This wiki is a knowledge-sharing website for Technical Bedrock, containing documentation, tutorials, and general how-to information.

# Contributing

You've found a typo, couldn't get along with a guide because it was too complicated or want to write your own guide to help other users create their own addons? Then you've come to the right place!

Our Bedrock wiki is fully open source and is maintained by our lovely community. And this community grows every day! If you want to be part of this community, get help on addons or just want to expand our wiki, you can join our Discord servers:

[Bedrock OSS](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN) - for wiki contributing and cool projects,
[Bedrock Add-Ons](https://discord.gg/pytC8zKHPn) - for add-on help.

If you want to help us create more complex things, like adding a new page or fixing some typos yourself, we have a dedicated [Contribute Page](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/contribute) on our wiki, which describes every step you need to follow. If you have some questions, there are some really nice people in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN).

## Code and Platform

The wiki uses a custom [VitePress theme](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/), and is statically generated from the `wiki` branch into the `generated` branch.

If you are interested in helping us maintain the core platform, as opposed to the markdown articles, [join the discord](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN)!
